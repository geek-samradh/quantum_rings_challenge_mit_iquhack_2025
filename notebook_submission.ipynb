    "## My Understanding of Shor's Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of Shor's Algorithm is to find prime factors of a large number (a huge threat to encryption technologies). But this ain't easy. The largest number to be factored on a **real quantum computer** was **21** in 2012, using 10 Qubits. The number to be factored on a **simulator** was **549,755,813,701** by a GPU based super computer. The real challenge lies in doing basic arithimetic fully quantumly.\n",

    "### Shor's Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Find a random number 'a'** such that:\n",
    "   - $2 < a < N$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **If** $\\gcd(a, N) > 1$, **then**:\n",
    "   - Done (the factor is $\\gcd(a, N)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Otherwise, continue to the next step**:\n",
    "   - Find $x$ for $f(x) = a^x \\mod N$, such that:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     a^x \\mod N = 1 \\quad \\text{(Let this be } r \\text{)}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Factor the number $N$** using:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\gcd(a^{r/2} \\pm 1, N)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   This gives the factors of $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **If the factors are not found,** start again with another random integer 'a'.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computational Steps for implementing Shor's Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pick a random number 'a'** such that:\n",
    "   - $2 < a < N$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check if $\\gcd(a, N) > 1$:**\n",
    "   - If $\\gcd(a, N) > 1$, I can immediately return $\\gcd(a, N)$ as a factor of $N$ and stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Find the order 'r' of 'a' modulo N:**\n",
    "   - I need to find the smallest integer $r$ such that $a^r \\equiv 1 \\pmod{N}$. This helps in finding the periodicity.\n",
    "   - To do this efficiently, I’ll use **Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)**, which relies on the **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Exponentiation Function:**\n",
    "   - I’ll use the exponentiation function $a^r \\mod N$ to compute powers of 'a' modulo $N$. This is crucial to finding the order 'r' using QPE.\n",
    "   - The function helps me compute very large powers efficiently using quantum methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Compute the factors of $N$:**\n",
    "   - If $r$ is even, I compute $a^{r/2} \\pm 1$ and then find $\\gcd(a^{r/2} \\pm 1, N)$. This gives the factors of $N$.\n",
    "   - If the factors are nontrivial, I return them as factors of $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Repeat if necessary:**\n",
    "   - If no factors are found, I pick a new random number 'a' and start over.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Post-processing:**\n",
    "   - Once I find factors, I return them as the nontrivial factors of $N$.\n",
    "   - If no factor is found in the classical step, I repeat the quantum part to try again.\n",

    "### Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)** is a quantum algorithm used to efficiently find periodicity in a quantum state. It is a key part of Shor's algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps of QFT:\n",
    "1. **Start with a superposition:**\n",
    "   - I begin by putting the quantum state in a superposition of possible states, like $|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Apply Hadamard Transform:**\n",
    "   - I apply the **Hadamard gate** on each qubit, which creates a superposition and spreads out the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Controlled Phase Rotation:**\n",
    "   - I apply **controlled phase gates** to entangle the qubits and apply phase shifts. This helps in detecting periodicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reverse the qubits:**\n",
    "   - After applying the transformations, I reverse the order of the qubits to complete the QFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "QFT is much faster than the classical Fourier transform and is used in Shor’s algorithm to find the period efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exponentiation Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Exponentiation Function** is used to calculate large powers modulo $N$ in Shor’s algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps for Exponentiation:\n",
    "1. I use the function $a^r \\mod N$ to find the order of $a$ modulo $N$.\n",
    "2. The function is efficient for computing large powers in quantum algorithms, helping find the period using quantum parallelism.\n",
    "3. Once I have the order 'r', I can compute the factors of $N$ through classical post-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exponentiation function allows me to compute large powers quickly, which is critical in the quantum part of Shor’s algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Real Problem when implementing Shor's Algorithm Quantumly\n",
    "\n",
    "You see modular exponentiation function is very easy to calculate, if done classically. But the corresponding circuit for quantum implementation if really hard to figure out. The easiest solution today is to design this function quantumly for specific values of \"a\" and \"N\". This code tries to address this, by dynamically creating this function for different values of \"a\" and \"N\"\n",
